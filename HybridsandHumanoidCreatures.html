                There are fairies named <b>Glaistig</b> in Scottish folklore. They are half a woman and half a goat. They can
                be kind or evil. Kind Glaistigs care for children and old men, look after pets. To thank Glaistig, it is
                enough to put a bowl with milk on the thresh-old of the house in the evening.
                Evil Gleystigs are blood-thirsty and hate people. They have female heads and trunks and goat hoofs
                instead of legs hidden by long green dresses. These dresses are sewed with gold threads. The women are
                so beautiful that hardly anyone can refuse them to have a dance. While dancing they will drink all
                human’s blood. All Gleystigs both kind and evil are able to fly and walk on the water like on the
                ground.

                <b>Gremlins</b> in English folklore are very harmful beings, haters of any equipment. They break all kinds of
                machines. They resemble a hybrid of a rabbit with a bull terri-er of about 50 centimeters height. They
                are dressed in green trousers and red jacket. Gremlins have webby paws so they move very quietly.
                Gremlins often play tricks on people.

                goes on hind legs and its eyes are like a flame. It can be seen in the street at midnight. Meeting with

                It is widely known that <b>Hobbits</b> have been thought up by the English writer John Tolkien. But actually
                they were known very long time ago. They are one of the kindest fairies in English mythology. Hobbits
                are modest and very ancient. They love peace and rest and work on cultivated land. They prefer
                prospering rural areas. They have sharp-sighted eyes and delicate ears. They tend to completeness and
                don't wish to fuss on trifles. However they are fast in movements. Hobbits are smaller than gnomes but
                not so fat. Hobbits put on clothes of bright colors and most of all they like yellow and green. Hobbits
                don't wear boots because skin on their feet is rough and rigid. Their feet are covered with thick curly
                hair. The faces of hobbits, as a rule, are rather good-natured, lips are always ready to stretch in a
                smile. Hobbits are hospi-table hosts. They like holidays and gifts which they willingly give and get
                with pleas-ure. In old times they spoke the language of people. </p>

                Sometimes it is heard as it walks about in the wood with heart-breaking cries. Usually Topotun is
                invisible, but sometimes it appears among people as a big black dog with flat eyes and long dense fur.
