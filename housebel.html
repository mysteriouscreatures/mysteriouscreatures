                In Belarus the whole class of house spirits is known as <b>Domovik</b>. It is a patron of the family and
                wellbeing in the house. Domovik has a wife Domovikha. They look like little people, but never show
                themselves to anyone. Domoviks are born, eat, drink, and die like people. They have character and can
                punish loud and inaccurate hosts, they don't love house scandals. They try to distract the hosts from
                unpleasant affairs by having hidden some things. Domoviks have sons and daughters.

                <b>Yevnik</b> is a character of Belarusian mythology, a symbol of rationality, practicality and economy. Its
                name comes from the word «yevnya», the place where it lives. Yevnya is a place where dry grain is well
                stored. It is similar to a big shapeless lump from bran with small short legs. Yevnik helps only its
                hosts and if strangers come into the drying house, it can frighten them. Yevnik is reserved but lovely
                and kind. As far as yevna is located near a bathhouse Yevnik is on friendly terms with its neighbor
                Laznik (from «laznya» - a bath) that lives in a bathhouse under a shelf.
