                Yevnik is a character of Belarusian mythology, a symbol of rationality, practicality and economy. Its name comes from the word «yevnya», the place where it lives. Yevnya is a place where dry grain is well stored. It is similar to a big shapeless lump from bran with small short legs. Yevnik helps only its hosts and if strangers come into the drying house, it can frighten them. Yevnik is reserved but lovely and kind. As far as yevna is located near a bathhouse Yevnik is on friendly terms with its neighbor Laznik (from «laznya» - a bath) that lives in a bathhouse under a shelf.
