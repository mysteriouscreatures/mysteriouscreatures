           As well as in many European countries, fairy tales about Gnomes are very popular in Britain. <b>Gnomes</b> are known as spirits of mountains and earth. So they live either in mountains or in the woods. In spite of the fact that gnomes resemble people though they are short, they have very remarkable features. Gnomes have a long and dense beard. Besides they have enormous physical strength. They live much longer than ordinary human beings. Like the majority of mythical beings, gnomes have a very nasty character and dislike all people.

          In the folklore of the Isle of Man there are spiteful fairies named <b>Hillmen</b>. Hill-men live in caves or on the hills and don't bare the sunlight. Therefore, they appear only at night. The main activity of Hillmen is to graze cattle that are of blue color for some reason. Hillmen kidnap women and children, set fire to barns and play other bad tricks. However, if you treat them with respect they will present a newborn with gold coins. At Halloween night Hillmen move from one cave to another, from hill to hill, and anyone whom they notice will face serious troubles.

          Almost in all countries you can find stories and drawings about huge people <b>Giants</b>. Giants of Britain are considered to be the most known ones. The hugest of them are the 70-meter "giant from Uilmington" in the County of Sussex and the 50-meter "person from Tsern" in the County of Dorset. A lot of historians and research-ers consider that such constructions as Stonehenge are the graves of the giants buried there deeply.

          <b>Trolls</b> are silly and spiteful elves, living in the mountain caves and in shabby, abandoned huts. However, quite often they can be met also under old bridges which they protect and demand a payment from the travelers wishing to cross the bridge. If a traveler refuses to pay, then trolls simply devour him. Trolls usually have one head, but some of them can have also two or three heads. Mountain trolls are the biggest and the dullest. They can't appear at sunlight as they are turned into stones.
