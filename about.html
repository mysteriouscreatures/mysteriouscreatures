            The actuality of this project is connected with a rising interest of adults and children towards books,
            cartoons, movies and Internet games where the main charac-ters are different mysterious creatures: elves,
            fairies, goblins, orcs and others. As a matter of fact, most of them are of British origin. So we decided to
            find more infor-mation about them and to compare them with Belarusian creatures.
            During our research we have learned the information about more than 100 mythical creatures of Belarusian
            folklore and about 500 creatures of British folklore. British folklore is wide as it includes mythological
            representatives of England, Scot-land, Wales and Ireland. It explains the superiority in the number of
            mysterious crea-tures.
            Besides folklore is a part of culture and history of any country. The knowledge of history and cultural
            traditions is an integral part of studying foreign languages. Myths, legends, poems, songs and ballads
            reflect the development and formation of the country and the mentality of its people.
            The material of our research work is both educational and entertaining. It can be used for English extra
            classes to increase students’ interest and their level of knowledge.

            Results of this work
            <br>
            The history and the culture of each country have their unique myths and leg-ends. Britain and Belarus are
            not an exception. Their myths and legends are rich in different spirits and mysterious creatures. People
            have always been interested in them. Though not so many of them believe in these creatures nowadays, the
            majority of people still prefer watching films, cartoons, playing computer games and reading books where the
            main characters are different mysterious beings. So we decided to summarize the information about them and
            create the Internet site “Mysterious Crea-tures”. This site will be interesting for children and adults as
            well. The language of our site is English. So it gives the opportunity to deepen your knowledge of English.
