                In English folklore Hobgoblin is a good-natured house fairy similar to brownie. It is about two feet
                high and they have dark skin. They walk either naked or in dark clothes. They seldom leave the house,
                preferring to get warm by the fire. However, they are very sensitive and offensive. They can make milk
                sour, tear the clothes and make a purely swept floor dirty. </p>

                Bug is a fairy spirit in English mythology. They frighten children. The appear-ance of bugs can be
                various. Usually these beings have an appearance of shaggy mon-sters with matted ragged wool. Some
                people compare them with brown bears. Many English children believe that bugs can get into rooms through
                open chimneys. Howev-er these creatures aren't aggressive and almost harmless. They have neither sharp
                teeth, nor long claws. Some bugs have quite frightening own names – Jannie Green Teeth, Skin - And -
                Bone, Tom - Look - in a - Chink. Each of them looks in its own way and carries out certain duties: for
                example, bug Lazy Laurence protects gardens from boys’ attacks. </p>
