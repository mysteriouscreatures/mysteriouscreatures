           In English mythology Boggart is a spirit or brownie. Usually Boggart is friend-ly with hosts where it lives, but sometimes it can do much harm just for fun. It is pos-sible to meet them at night. They can look like real monsters in the dark. It`s almost impossible to get rid of Boggart.  The only way is to change the house.

            Red Caps are nearly the most spiteful goblins in English folklore. They live in ruins of ancient towers and fortresses along the Scottish border. They often fought in bloody battles and they coloured their caps with human blood. Red Caps have long, sticking-out fangs, bony fingers with claws, huge bloodshot eyes, matted dirty hair. They wear iron boots. In other sources they are cannibals and eat Fairies and people.

             In English folklore there are other cruel goblins, cannibals and kidnappers named Hobii. Before eating kidnapped people Hobii make them work in the under-ground mines and extract gold. Hobii aren't afraid of anything and anybody except dogs.

         In English mythology there are nasty fairies named Orcs. They are very silly and spiteful creatures, extremely blood-thirsty. They are afraid of sunlight and live underground or in the subsoil of mountains, in dark wet caves, coming to the surface only at night. Orcs usually serve evil powers. In functions and habits they are similar to Red caps. Orcs are soldiers and they always attack in groups. They are awful with sharp-toothed spiteful muzzles, ominous fiery eyes and swamp - brown skin.

         Gooseberry`s wife is one of the most bright representatives of rural children's horror stories. It is well-known on the Isle of Wight and it has an appearance of a huge hairy caterpillar that protects gooseberry bushes and frightens disobedient chil-dren.
