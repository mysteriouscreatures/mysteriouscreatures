         In British mythology Elves are strange beings. They live in the woods and on hills. They are not angry, but it`s difficult to call them kind either. Elves usually have supernatural abilities, often related to the cure of different illnesses. They are also good at entrapping human beings with their music and dance. Some elves are little fairy-like creatures, almost invisible and some of them are human-sized. Generally they are immortal. Elves like to steal not only gold but newborns as well.

         In Irish folklore there are small beings similar to gnomes living on the hills of Ireland named Leprekons or shoemakers. It is known that Leprekons always wish to drink therefore they quite often can be met in wine cellars. They  also adore tobacco and usually puff a pipe. It is believed that almost each Leprekon has a gold pot. If a person is lucky and has caught a Leprekon, he can force it to show the place where its gold is hidden. But yet nobody has ever managed to deceive a Leprekon, it will always find a way to be turned out and get away. Leprekon looks very exotic, it`s got light skin, a wrinkled face, a bright red nose. It wears on a cocked hat, green trousers and a vest with enormous brilliant buttons, the leather apron, long blue stockings and high boots with silver buckles that just a little less than boots.

          In Celtic mythology Oaklets are evil magical creatures living in the crowns and trunks of oaks. They offer delicious food and gifts to everyone who is passing by their homes. In no case you should take their food or taste it because the food cooked by Oaklets is very poisonous. At night Oaklets often wander. It is necessary to know that passing by Oaklets living in cut down oaks is dangerous because they are angry and can do a lot of trouble.

          In English folklore wood fairies are called Green women as all their existence is connected with trees. Most often they live in oaks, elms, willows and yew-trees, but sometimes they choose pines, holly and apple-trees. Green women are quite severe; they will never miss opportunities to frighten late travelers. It is said that they adore primroses. If you put these flowers near the tree they live you will get goodwill from Green women.
