            Folklore is an integral part of any national culture. The main elements of it are myths, legends, ballads,
            sayings, songs, fairy-tales and descriptions of various mythological and mysterious creatures. Supernatural
            creatures have existed in folklore of all countries since ancient times. Most of them are believed to exist
            in particular countries, areas or landscape habitats and can potentially be analyzed geographically. Besides
            there are so many kinds of mysterious creatures and various beliefs concerning their shape, character and
            habits that is directly connected with cultural roots and related folklore. The study of mysterious
            creatures allows us to look into the past, to get deeper understanding of the worldview of our ancestors.
            The surrounding nature with its disasters often terrified them. Humans couldn't find an explanation or any
            logical understanding of the events and interpreted them in their own way. In their opinion ex-actly
            mysterious creatures were guilty of what was happening. Belief in the forces of nature was unlimited.
            Ancient mythological creatures were worshiped and sacrificed. It was dangerous to disturb and offend such
            creatures. </p>
