Supernatural creatures have existed in folklore of all countries since ancient times. Most of them are believed to reside in particular countries, areas or landscape habitats. These can potentially be analyzed geographically. As there are so many kinds of mythical creatures and so various beliefs concerning their shape, character and habits, most of the reliable information sources are dedicated to just one or several types of such beings, their definitions, cultural roots and related folklore.

The study of mysterious creatures allows us to look into the past, to get deeper un-derstanding of the worldview of our ancestors. The surrounding nature with its disasters often terrified them. Humans couldn't find an explanation or any logical understanding of the events and interpreted them in their own way. In their opinion exactly mysterious crea-tures were guilty of what was happening. Belief in the forces of nature was unlimited. An-cient mythological creatures were worshiped and sacrificed. It was dangerous to disturb and offend such creatures.
