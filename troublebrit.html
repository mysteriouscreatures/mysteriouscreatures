                In English mythology <b> Boggart </b>  is a spirit or brownie. Usually Boggart is friend-ly with hosts where it
                lives, but sometimes it can do much harm just for fun. It is possible to meet them at night. They can
                look like real monsters in the dark. It`s almost impossible to get rid of Boggart. The only way is to
                change the house. Kalyakh-vare is a well-known witch of Scottish folklore, the spirit of winter and
                cold, the patroness of wild animals and fish. It is a skinny witch with a blue face. On the eve of each
                Halloween Kalyakh-vare is born again and then walks on the ground causing snow. On the eve of the first
                of May it leaves and turns into a grey stone. Kalyakh-vare protects lots of different animals. Most of
                all it likes deer. They are its cattle. It herds and milks them, often saves them from hunters.

                <b>Red Caps</b> are nearly the most spiteful goblins in English folklore. They live in ruins of ancient towers
                and fortresses along the Scottish border. They often fought in bloody battles and they coloured their
                caps with human blood. Red Caps have long, stickingout fangs, bony fingers with claws, huge bloodshot
                eyes, matted dirty hair. They wear iron boots. In other sources they are cannibals and eat Fairies and
                people. </p>

                In English folklore there are other cruel goblins, cannibals and kidnappers named Hobii. Before eating
                kidnapped people<b> Hobii</b> make them work in the underground mines and extract gold. Hobii aren't afraid of
                anything and anybody except dogs. </p>

                In English mythology there are nasty fairies named<b> Orcs</b>. They are very silly and spiteful creatures,
                extremely bloodthirsty. They are afraid of sunlight and live underground or in the subsoil of
                mountains, in dark wet caves, coming to the surface only at night. Orcs usually serve evil powers. In
                functions and habits they are similar to Red caps. Orcs are soldiers and they always attack in groups.
                They are awful with sharp-toothed spiteful muzzles, ominous fiery eyes and swamp - brown skin. </p>

               <b> Gooseberry`s wife </b>is one of the most bright representatives of rural children's horror stories. It is
                wellknown on the Isle of Wight and it has an appearance of a huge hairy caterpillar that protects
                gooseberry bushes and frightens disobedient children.
