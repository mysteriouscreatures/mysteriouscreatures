               <b> Aughisky </b> is a mythological Scottish water spirit. It is also known as a Water horse. It likes to leave
                water, to jump in fields turning into a beautiful horse. It is said that wild Aughisky often attacks
                human cattle and eats it. </p>

               <b> Grindylow </b>lives in lakes and marshes throughout Britain and Ireland. It is a horned, pale green demon.
                British Grindylow is very aggressive towards people. It grabs a man with its long fingers, drags him
                into the depths of the lake and drown.

                The UK water spirit <b> Kumara </b> keeps an eye on all incidents in the sea. It has green hair, long green
                teeth, a red nose and little pig eyes, short hands like fins, skin covered with scales and a long fish
                tail instead of legs. It doesn’t cause bad weather and storms but collects the souls of drowned sailors
                and closes them in shells. If you meet Kumara and say Hello politely, it can offer you a tour to the
                underwater world.

                In English folklore <b> Dracks</b> are water creatures appearing in the form of floating wooden dishes that lure
                women. When a woman grabs such a dish Drack immediately shows its true ugly form and drags the poor
                woman to the bottom to take care of its children.

                Water ladies in Scottish folklore are called <b>Asrai</b>. They are timid and shy, live at the bottom of the
                sea and in deep lakes. The main enemy of the British Asraya is men. These little creatures are so
                beautiful that men cannot help grabbing them. They have long green hair and webbed feet. They don't wear
                clothes. Every hundred years Asrai come to the surface to admire the moonlight. In the sun they
                evaporate and turn into a tiny puddle.

                In the folklore of the Orkney Islands near Scotland there are sea fairies named<b> Selki</b>. They are the
                seal-people, kind beings with brown eyes. Selki`s skin allows them to live in the sea. However they have
                to come up from water from time to time to breathe air. When Selkis come to the coast, they dump skins
                and turn into indescribable beauties. If you steal the dumped skin, Selki will remain on the land as
                without skin they can’t survive under water. If it marries, its children will have small webbed fingers
                and in addition they will have abilities to cure.
