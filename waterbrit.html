           The UK water spirit Kumara keeps an eye on all incidents in the sea. It has green hair, long green teeth, a red nose and little pig eyes, short hands like fins, skin covered with scales and a long fish tail instead of legs. It doesn’t cause bad weather and storms but collects the souls of drowned sailors and closes them in shells. If you meet Kumara and say Hello politely, it can offer you a tour to the underwater world.

          Water ladies in Scottish folklore are called Asrai. They are timid and shy, live at the bottom of the sea and in deep lakes. The main enemy of the British Asraya is men. These little creatures are so beautiful that men cannot help grabbing them. They have long green hair and webbed feet. They don't wear clothes. Every hundred years Asrai come to the surface to admire the moonlight. In the sun they evaporate and turn into a tiny puddle.

    In the folklore of the Orkney Islands near Scotland there are sea fairies named Selki. They are the seal-people, kind beings with brown eyes. Selki`s skin allows them to live in the sea. However they have to come up from water from time to time to breathe air. When Selkis come to the coast, they dump skins and turn into indescriba-ble beauties. If you steal the dumped skin, Selki will remain on the land as without skin they can’t survive under water. If it marries, its children will have small webbed fingers and in addition they will have abilities to cure.
